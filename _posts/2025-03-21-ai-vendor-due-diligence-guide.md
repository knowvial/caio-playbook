# AI Vendor Due Diligence: Essential Questions and Red Flags

*This is Part 2 of our AI Vendor Risk Management series. [Read Part 1](/caio-playbook/2025/03/14/ai-vendor-risk-new-reality/) to understand why traditional TPRM fails for AI vendors.*

After conducting over 200 AI vendor assessments across mid-sized organizations, a clear pattern emerges: **traditional vendor questionnaires identify less than 30% of AI-specific risks**. Standard cybersecurity and operational questions simply cannot capture the unique challenges posed by model behavior, training data issues, bias risks, and algorithmic transparency concerns.

This post provides CAIOs with comprehensive due diligence frameworks specifically designed for AI vendors. These aren't theoretical checklists—they're battle-tested questionnaires, evaluation methodologies, and red flag indicators developed from real-world AI vendor failures and successful implementations.

## The AI Due Diligence Framework

Effective AI vendor due diligence requires a **four-tier assessment approach** that builds on traditional TPRM while addressing AI-specific risks:

### Tier 1: Enhanced Traditional Assessment
Standard due diligence enhanced with AI-specific considerations

### Tier 2: AI Model Governance Assessment  
Deep evaluation of model development, testing, and management practices

### Tier 3: Data and Privacy Evaluation
AI-specific data handling, training data sources, and privacy protections

### Tier 4: Transparency and Compliance Review
Explainability capabilities and regulatory compliance readiness

Each tier includes specific questions, evaluation criteria, and scoring methodologies tailored for different AI vendor risk levels.

## Tier 1: Enhanced Traditional Assessment

Traditional due diligence areas require AI-specific enhancements to capture relevant risks:

### Financial Stability and Business Continuity

**Standard Questions Enhanced for AI Context:**

**Q: How do you ensure business continuity for AI services?**
- *Traditional Focus*: Backup data centers, disaster recovery procedures
- *AI Enhancement*: Model backup and restoration procedures, training data preservation, specialized talent retention

**Q: What is your approach to AI service evolution and deprecation?**
- *Why This Matters*: AI vendors frequently discontinue models or change architectures with minimal notice
- *Red Flags*: No model lifecycle planning, frequent service changes without customer notification
- *Green Flags*: Clear model versioning strategy, 12+ month deprecation notices, migration support

**Q: Describe your AI talent retention and knowledge transfer processes.**
- *Why This Matters*: Loss of key AI personnel can fundamentally alter service quality
- *Red Flags*: Single points of failure for critical models, no documented knowledge transfer procedures
- *Green Flags*: Team redundancy, comprehensive documentation, knowledge sharing practices

### Information Security with AI Considerations

**Q: How do you protect against AI-specific attack vectors?**

## Red Flags That Should End Vendor Consideration

Based on analysis of AI vendor failures, certain responses should immediately disqualify vendors from consideration:

### Immediate Disqualifiers

**"Our AI is inherently unbiased"** or **"We don't need to test for bias"**
- *Why It's Dangerous*: Demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of AI bias
- *Alternative Required*: Specific bias testing methodologies and mitigation procedures

**"We can't explain how our models make decisions—they're too complex"**
- *Why It's Dangerous*: Regulatory compliance impossible, accountability absent
- *Alternative Required*: At minimum, general explanation capabilities and model interpretability

**"We use all publicly available data for training"**
- *Why It's Dangerous*: Likely copyright violations, unknown bias sources, compliance risks
- *Alternative Required*: Curated, documented training data sources with legal compliance

**"Model updates are proprietary and we don't notify customers"**
- *Why It's Dangerous*: Unpredictable behavior changes, impossible change management
- *Alternative Required*: Advance notification, change documentation, rollback capabilities

**"We can't provide performance metrics—they're trade secrets"**
- *Why It's Dangerous*: Impossible to assess fit for purpose or monitor degradation
- *Alternative Required*: Basic performance metrics and monitoring capabilities

### Concerning Responses Requiring Further Investigation

**Vague answers about data sources**: May indicate problematic training data
**No bias testing procedures**: Suggests lack of responsible AI practices  
**Limited explainability options**: May prevent regulatory compliance
**Frequent model changes without notification**: Indicates poor change management
**No rollback capabilities**: Suggests inadequate risk management

## Vendor Risk Classification Framework

Based on due diligence results, classify AI vendors into risk categories:

## Next Steps: From Assessment to Contracts

Due diligence identifies risks—contracts must address them. The next post in this series covers **AI-specific contract language, SLAs, and liability frameworks** that translate assessment findings into enforceable vendor obligations.

Effective AI vendor contracts go far beyond traditional service agreements to address model performance guarantees, bias testing requirements, explainability provisions, and regulatory compliance support.
